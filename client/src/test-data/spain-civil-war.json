  "detailedSummary": "A concise, three-minute documentary lecture on the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), tracing its roots in the polarized Second Republic, the failed coup that split the country, the international intervention, key battles and atrocities, the revolutionary experiments and internal conflicts within the Republic, the Nationalist consolidation and final victory, and the long Franco dictatorship that followed. The script is divided into ~15-second segments with suggested visuals, music cues, and sound effects to support a sober, adult-oriented presentation.",
  "segments": [
    {
      "narration": "Spain in the 1930s was a nation pulled taut between old hierarchies and new hopes. Landowners, the Church, and the army faced workers, peasants, and reformers pressing for change. The result would be one of the twentieth century’s most consequential civil wars.",

    {
      "narration": "In 1931 the Second Republic promised land reform, secular schools, and regional autonomy, alarming conservatives. Violent clashes escalated, from the miners’ revolt in Asturias in 1934 to street fights between fascists and leftist militias. The Popular Front narrowly won elections in February 1936, and polarization hardened.",

    {
      "narration": "On July 17 and 18, 1936, a military uprising erupted from Spanish Morocco and spread to the mainland. The coup failed to seize the whole country, splitting Spain into Nationalist and Republican zones. General Francisco Franco emerged as the Nationalists’ leader after rivals fell away.",

      "narration": "The conflict internationalized at once. Hitler and Mussolini sent aircraft, tanks, and troops; Portugal offered support. The Soviet Union supplied the Republic, and volunteers from over fifty countries formed the International Brigades. Britain and France led a Non-Intervention policy that largely starved the Republic of arms.",

    {
      "narration": "Madrid became a symbol of resistance. Crowds shouted No pasarán as militias and the International Brigades held the capital in 1936. The battles of Jarama and Guadalajara stalled the Nationalists, with Italian forces routed in spring 1937.",

      "narration": "Behind the lines, terror scarred both camps. In Republican zones early chaos saw anticlerical killings and massacres like Paracuellos. Nationalist forces conducted systematic reprisals, including mass executions from Badajoz onward. Tens of thousands were murdered away from the front.",

      "narration": "Modern warfare arrived from the sky. On April 26, 1937, the German Condor Legion bombed the Basque town of Guernica, devastating civilians and shocking the world. Picasso’s Guernica turned the ruins into a universal indictment of terror from above.",

      "narration": "Amid war, revolution surged in Republican zones. Anarchists and socialists collectivized farms and factories in Catalonia and Aragon.

      "narration": "The war’s bloodiest set-piece battles followed. Teruel in the winter of 1937–38 drained both sides. The Republican Ebro offensive in 1938 was bold but costly, as air power and artillery ground down exhausted units and the river ran with retreating soldiers.",

Franco ruled until 1975, and the struggle over memory continues, from mass grave exhumations to debates about monuments. The Spanish Civil War stands as a warning about how democracy can unravel under pressure—and how the world’s rival ideologies once collided on a single battlefield.",
