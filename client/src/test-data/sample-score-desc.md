Title: Æthelstan – First King of England (3:00 documentary score)

Overall brief:

Duration: ~3:00, continuous cue with clear sectional arcs; seamless crossfades, no hard cuts.
Style: Cinematic documentary with early medieval color. Blend Anglo-Saxon timbres (lyre, harp, fiddle/rebec, wooden flute, frame drum, bone/bronze horn) with modern orchestral bed (strings, low brass, war drums, men’s chorus), and subtle sound-design textures (anvils/coin clinks, parchment/rustle-like shakers).
Core palette: String orchestra, solo cello, viola da gamba/viol, nyckelharpa or medieval fiddle, Anglo-Saxon lyre/harp, wooden flutes/whistles, hand percussion (frame drum, bodhrán, tabor), taiko/gran cassa for scale, low brass (horns, trombones), men’s chant (no lyrics or vowel syllables ah/um/o), female airy pads for light, metallic percussion (anvils, coin chimes), temple blocks, subtle drones.
Tonal world: Modal (Dorian/Aeolian), with strong root focus on D and G. Use open fifths to evoke age. Modern harmonic lift for triumph moments without sounding romanticized.
Tempos: Begin 64 BPM (grave), rise to 86–92 BPM for consolidation, 112–116 BPM for battle, return to 72–78 BPM noble resolution.
Leitmotifs:

Æthelstan Theme (Sovereign): Noble, stepwise ascending 4-note motif (D–F–G–A), often in solo horn/cello, harmonized by strings. Associated with unity and lawful authority.
House of Wessex Motif: Lyre/harp arpeggio on open fifths (D–A), delicate, for roots and lineage.
Law and Coin Motif: Short metallic ostinato (anvil/coin chime: D–E–D) with measured pulse in pizz strings.
Northumbrian Shadow Motif: Minor third drop (A–F) in low strings/horn, with distant horn echo, for contested lands.
Christian/Chant Color: Men’s chorus on open fifths (D–A) moving to Dorian cadences for solemnity.
Diplomacy Motif: Gentle modal woodwind figure (G–A–B–A), light counterpoint, strings con sordino.
Structure with timecodes and scene scoring:

0:00–0:18 Scene 1 – Push North and East

Tempo 64 BPM. Low drones (D). Anglo-Saxon lyre pulses the Wessex arpeggio quietly. Solo cello introduces Æthelstan Theme embryonically, pianissimo.
Texture: Misty strings, breathy wooden flute. Hint Northumbrian Shadow Motif in horn (pp).
Mood: Patient resolve, frontier tension.
0:18–0:38

Add frame drum heartbeat (soft, every 2 bars). Strings widen; viola answers cello. Subtle distant war horn for Northumbria “beyond grasp.”
Harmony: D Dorian with suspended 2nds. Maintain restraint.
0:38–1:00 Scene 2 – Coronation and Binding the Realm

Tempo nudges to 78 BPM. Men’s choir enters (ah), open fifths; solo horn states full Æthelstan Theme, clear and confident.
Harp/lyre brighten; strings con sordino add warm bed. Brief regal cymbal swell (felt mallet).
Mood: Consecration turning to administrative purpose.
1:00–1:20 Scene 3 – York Seized, Overlordship at Eamont

Tempo 86 BPM. Brass (horns) chorale answers theme; wooden flutes outline Diplomacy Motif softly above.
Percussion: Light tabor patterns; no martial aggression—measured assertion. Choir crescendos to a luminous cadence: “one ruler holds all English lands.”
1:20–1:38 Scene 4 – Law, Weights, Coinage

Strings and pizzicato introduce Law and Coin Motif (anvil/coin chime D–E–D synced with light temple block). Harp runs precise, clockwork-like.
Harmony: Move to G Dorian for freshness. Add subtle page-turn shakers.
Mood: Order, standardization, authority tightening.
1:38–1:58 Scene 5 – Europe-Facing Court

Woodwinds (recorders/whistles) play the Diplomacy Motif intertwining with a gentle string ostinato. Brief female airy pad to suggest continental breadth.
Harp harmonics; soft tambourine for courtly elegance. Reference Otto/Franks by a brief parallel-third woodwind line (continental color).
Keep energy contained; no over-sentimentality.
1:58–2:22 Scene 6 – Brunanburh

Tempo surge to 114 BPM. War drums (bodhrán + gran cassa), low strings in tremolo. Horns state Æthelstan Theme in minor coloration, then snap to bold major inflections.
Percussion: Taiko accents; snares without snares (tabor) for period feel. Choir shifts to rhythmic ah/um pulses (no words).
Insert fleeting enemy colors: high fiddle gliss for Norse, low drone against scale for Scots, then unify under the main theme.
Climax at 2:15 with full brass/choir hit; cut reverb tail into next section.
2:22–2:36 Scene 7 – Supremacy Recognized

Tempo relaxes to 84 BPM. Strings broad, victorious but dignified. Æthelstan Theme in strings legato; woodwinds gently restate Diplomacy Motif as homage from Wales/northern lords.
Avoid triumphal bombast; emphasize legitimacy and breadth.
2:36–2:50 Scene 8 – Death, Aftermath

Tempo 72 BPM. Texture thins. Solo cello and lyre reprise Wessex arpeggio. Men’s choir soft, funereal open fifths. Northumbrian Shadow Motif resolves upward (A–B) to show endurance.
Metallic chime once (coin) to symbolize lasting framework.
2:50–3:00 Scene 9 – First King of England

Final summation. Horn and cello in unison on Æthelstan Theme; strings support in luminous D major/Dorian blend. Gentle cymbal swell, choir holds a quiet open fifth.
Last chord: sustained D–A–D with harp harmonic and faint coin chime. Resolve to silence on breath.
Dynamics and mix notes:

Keep early instruments forward and tactile; orchestra supportive, not overpowering, except at Brunanburh.
Choir always vowel-based, no text. Avoid Hollywood cliché; use modal harmony and open intervals.
Sub-bass only during battle and coronation cadences; otherwise light low end for documentary clarity.
Smooth scene transitions via shared motifs and sustained drones.

Strings, Brass, Choir, Early Instruments (lyre/harp/fiddle/flutes), Percussion (war drums/tabor/coin/anvil), Sound design (shakers/page/air).
