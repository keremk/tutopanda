# Replicate Integration Test Data

Place your seed assets for the Replicate integration tests in this folder.

## Required Files
- `seed-image.jpg`: starting frame that will be referenced by `replicate-video-provider.test.ts`
- `seed-video.mp4`: sample output clip used by `generate-segment-videos.integration.test.ts`

Feel free to replace the filename in the test if you use a different asset.
