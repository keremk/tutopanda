# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Tutopanda is now a pnpm workspace with four packages.
- `client/` (`tutopanda-client`) remains the Next.js 15 web client. Routes live in `src/app` (group folders follow Next.js conventions), shared UI in `src/components`, hooks in `src/hooks`, utilities in `src/lib`, and validation in `src/schema.ts`. The client is mid-refactor as movie generation shifts into the backend stack.
- `server/` (`tutopanda-server`) hosts the API surface on Nitro/h3; group routes under `server/server/routes` with handlers composed from shared logic. Runtime output is still emitted to `server/dist/` (ignored by git). Coordinate with the core library for all movie generation.
- `core/` (`tutopanda-core`) is the shared TypeScript library for orchestrating AI-based movie asset generation. Source lives under `src/`, with published entry points in `src/index.ts`. Build artifacts go to `dist/`.
- `cli/` (`tutopanda-cli`) provides a command-line workflow for generating movies, backed by the core package. Keep the Ink entry point in `src/cli.tsx` and organise reusable UI under `src/`.

Consult `design_guidelines.md` before adjusting visuals in the client, and keep shared logic inside `core/` whenever possible to avoid duplication across the API and CLI surfaces.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run `pnpm install` once to hydrate the workspaces. Use `pnpm dev` for the combined web client and API loop, or `pnpm dev:client` / `pnpm dev:server` for focused development (CLI and core expose `pnpm --filter tutopanda-<pkg> dev` watchers when needed). Build artifacts either via `pnpm build` or per-package scripts such as `pnpm --filter tutopanda-core build`. Linting and type checks run through the package names: e.g. `pnpm --filter tutopanda-client lint`, `pnpm --filter tutopanda-core type-check`, `pnpm --filter tutopanda-cli lint`. Vitest is wired the same way (`pnpm --filter tutopanda-server test`, etc.). Use the actual package names with `--filter` when invoking commands from the repo root.

> **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT** DO NOT JUST ADD default fallbacks just to make sure that you have something, especially for inputs that are expected. Than you are silently failing and making some random assumptions. Always throw, fail fast and so those can be fixed.

> **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT** Absolutely no fallbacks: never quietly substitute defaults or best guesses when inputs or mappings are missing. Fail fast, surface the missing value, and stop before calling any SDK so issues can be fixed explicitly.

> **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT** When running vitest, make sure to cd into the project and run it there, here is how to do for CLI for example.
```bash
cd cli && pnpm vitest run --pool=threads --poolOptions.threads.singleThread
```

> **VERY IMPORTANT** Do not add “extra defensive” guards (e.g. `typeof source.durationMultiplier === 'number' ? ...` as a silent fallback). Trust the defined schema/mapping; if a value is absent or malformed, throw immediately instead of guessing or defaulting.

> **Important**: Do not write overly defensive code. Do production quality checking but do not write it in an overly defensive way. Clear and readable code is the key. Don’t add speculative guards, elaborate null checks, or fallback branches that handle scenarios we don’t actually expect today. Stick to the known contract, keep control flow straightforward, and only handle concrete failure modes we already understand (e.g., validation errors that truly happen).

> **Important**: Do **not** run `pnpm install` as a build step or during routine development tasks—only run it when specifically instructed to hydrate dependencies.

> **Agent Rule**: Never run package-management commands (`pnpm add`, `pnpm install`, etc.) without explicit user approval. Always surface the dependency request to the user instead.

> **Agent Rule**: Never use `git checkout` or other destructive git commands to reset files. Always coordinate with the user if a revert is needed.

> **Agent Rule**: When you see an /* eslint-disable no-unused-vars */ Do NOT delete it. It is there for a reason to turn off an overeager rule trying it on Interfaces.

> **Agent Rule**: Providers Vitest runs must stay on the threads pool; run `pnpm --filter tutopanda-providers test` from the repo root (the config already pins `pool: 'threads'`). If you need to run it manually inside the package use:
```bash
cd providers && pnpm vitest run --config vitest.config.ts --pool=threads
```

> **Agent Rule**: Never run `git restore`, `git checkout`, `git clean`, or any other destructive git command without explicit user consent. Confirm with the user before invoking any command that might drop local changes.

> **Agent Rule**: Never generate build artefacts (e.g. `.js`, `.d.ts`, `.map`) inside `core/src` or other source directories. Keep generated output inside the designated `dist/` folders by running the appropriate package build.

> **Agent Rule**: When cross-package types or builds are needed, rely on the workspace packages' documented build outputs (`dist/`) or ask the user for guidance. Do not create ad-hoc shims or shortcuts; pause and ask if unsure.

> **Agent Rule**: Never delete files without explicit confirmation from the user.

> **Agent Rule**: Always propagate and consume the canonical node IDs (`Input:…`, `Artifact:…`, `Producer:…`). Do not introduce alias-based fallbacks or heuristic lookups—if a canonical binding is missing, throw a descriptive error so the blueprint or plan can be fixed explicitly.

> **Agent Rule**: Canonical IDs must flow end-to-end. The planner emits a single canonical artefact/input ID (e.g. `Artifact:MusicPromptGenerator.MusicPrompt`). The runner copies those exact IDs into each job’s context (`job.context.inputs`, `inputBindings`, `fanIn`, and `resolvedInputs`). Providers must read only that canonical ID (via `runtime.sdk.buildPayload`, `runtime.inputs.getByNodeId`, or fan-in descriptors) and never look up aliases or “best guesses”. If a canonical ID is missing, fail immediately so the upstream blueprint/plan can be fixed instead of synthesizing a fallback. This applies to every artefact, prompt variable, and attachment across the CLI/core/provider boundary.

> **Agent Rule**: When resolving blueprint/config paths (e.g., locating `config/blueprints`), use the shared helpers in `cli/src/lib/config-assets.ts` (`getBundledBlueprintsRoot`, `getCliConfigRoot`, `resolveBlueprintSpecifier`, etc.) instead of hardcoded paths.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Write strict TypeScript and prefer functional React components with kebab-case filenames. Route segment folders in `src/app` should follow Next.js rules (`(group)`, `[param]`, etc.). Use Tailwind utilities and the design tokens defined in `tailwind.config.ts` instead of ad-hoc CSS. Internal imports should use the configured aliases such as `@/components/*` and `@/lib/*`. Reuse helpers from `src/lib` before adding new utilities, and keep new files two-space indented to match the existing style.

- Optimise for clarity first: avoid adding defensive guards or nested ternaries that obscure intent unless there is a concrete bug being handled. Prefer small helper functions or straightforward control flow.
- Avoid overly defensive TypeScript patterns (e.g., repeatedly checking `foo && typeof foo === 'object' && !Array.isArray(foo)`). Trust the known contract and let bad inputs surface as real errors instead of speculative guards.

## Testing Guidelines
The repo still relies on linting and type checks as the baseline gate, but all packages are wired for Vitest. Add tests for new behaviour (`.test.ts`/`.test.tsx` next to the code) across client, server, core, and CLI. Ensure each package exposes the relevant `test` scripts and use `pnpm --filter <package> test` from the root. Document any fixture data inside its package and keep runs deterministic.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Follow the `<type>: <summary>` pattern seen in history (example `init: first version that runs on Next.js`). Keep subjects imperative and scope commits to one concern. Pull requests should explain the change, link tracking issues, and include screenshots or clips for UI updates. Add a testing note listing the commands you ran (at minimum `pnpm check`). Call out required follow-ups such as database pushes or environment changes before requesting review.
